/* This is a demonstration of the attr() function in CSS.
 * The attr() function can be used to retrieve the value of an attribute
 * and use it in CSS properties. In this case, we are using it to set
 * the background color of the box based on a custom data attribute.

/* Note, the red background color is commented out.
 * The attr() function will use the value of the data-color attribute
 * to set the background color of the box.
 * If the data-color attribute in the html is not set, it will default to red.
